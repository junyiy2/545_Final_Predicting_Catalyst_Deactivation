    "## **Predicting Catalyst Deactivation using Multi-Layer Perceptron** <br>\n",
    "In this final project, you will develop a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network using scikit-learn as well as your own customized deep learning model using tensorflow to predict catalyst deactivation in chemical processes. Catalysts are essential in many chemical engineering operations, but they can lose effectiveness over time due to various mechanisms including poisoning, fouling, sintering, and thermal degradation. Predicting when a catalyst will deactivate is crucial for scheduling maintenance and optimizing process economics.\n",
    "You have been provided with a .csv file with some attributes about the catalyst and a deactivation state.  Do data preprocessing if necessary at any step, always use a random seed wherever you can and describe your methods and results in detail. All plots should have labels and legends. \n",
